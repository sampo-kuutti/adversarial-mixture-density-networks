# pythonapi.py imports the api.dll which provides functionality for communicating with IPG Carmaker
# the file also defines all the necessary functions from the c api.dll for reading relevant simulation data
# as well as controlling the host vehicle gas and brake pedals

# Note, if you don't have access to the shared safeav directory, you will need to change the API dll path to where
# you have the ipg api saved.
